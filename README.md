# Recursive-Blockchain-Darknet-silene

A Recursive Blockchain to be allowed onto a darknet or new network.

## Introduction

Recent advanecements in recursive composition of zero-knowledge proofs have led to creation of **succinct blockchains** as in examples such as [mina protocol](https://minaprotocol.com/) and [halo2](https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-releases-code-for-halo-2/) (In Zcash). My blog post on this matter can be read [here](https://atropinetears.github.io/blog/3.html). These constant-size blockchains are small in size making verifying the blockchain very easy. For example, mina comes in at 22kb in size and is constant. Due to their small size, it is easy to verify a full blockchain.

Another such example of zero-knowledge proofs can be seen in ethereums zk-rollups which provide zero-knowledge proofs. One example of this is starknet which uses zk-starks.

These powerful technologies can be used for various reasons.

## Construction of Networks Using Succinct Blockchains

Networks, like a darknet or a decentralized network, can be constructed using succicnt blockchains where only a 22kb (as in the case of mina) should be downloaded to verify the state of the blockchain. This is extremly powerful and lets users easily access a network using **succinct blockchains**.
